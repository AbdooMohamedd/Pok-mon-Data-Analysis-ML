## About the Dataset
The Pokémon dataset provides detailed information about various Pokémon, including their types, stats, and other characteristics. This dataset is ideal for practicing data analysis, visualization, and cleaning techniques.

## Project Structure
1. **Import Necessary Libraries:** Import all the required libraries for data analysis and visualization.
2. **Read the Data:** Load the Pokémon dataset into a DataFrame for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
4. **Data Cleaning:** Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, handling outliers, and standardizing text columns.
5. **Data Analysis:** Answer specific questions about the dataset using pandas and create visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib.
6. **Conclusion:** Summarize the findings from the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of summarizing and visualizing the important characteristics of a dataset. In this step, we will:
- Understand the structure of the dataset
- Generate summary statistics
- Visualize distributions and relationships between variables

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is essential to prepare the data for analysis. It involves:

### Dealing with Missing Data
Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset.

### Dealing with Data Types
Convert data types to appropriate formats to ensure accurate analysis.

### Handling Duplicate Values
Identify and remove any duplicate records in the dataset.

### Handling Outliers
Detect and handle outliers to mitigate their impact on the analysis.

### Standardizing Text Columns Data
Standardize text data to ensure consistency across the dataset.

## Data Analysis
### Answering Questions Using Data Analysis (Pandas)
Answer specific questions about the Pokémon dataset using pandas. Some example questions include:
1. What is the average HP of Pokémon by generation?
2. Which type of Pokémon has the highest average attack?
3. What is the distribution of Pokémon by their primary type?
4. How many legendary Pokémon are there in each generation?
5. What are the top 5 Pokémon with the highest defense?
6. What is the correlation between different Pokémon stats?
7. Which Pokémon have Mega Evolutions?
8. How does the average speed of Pokémon vary by type?
9. What is the relationship between a Pokémon's weight and its attack?
10. Which Pokémon have the highest total stats in each generation?

### Creating Visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
Create visualizations to better understand the data and communicate insights. Some example visualizations include:
1. Distribution of Pokémon Total Stats
2. Average Stats by Generation
3. Box Plot of Pokémon Stats by Type
4. Scatter Plot of Weight vs. Attack
5. Heatmap of Correlation Between Pokémon Stats
6. Count Plot of Pokémon by Generation
7. Bar Plot of Average Speed by Type
8. Pie Chart of Legendary vs. Non-Legendary Pokémon
9. Line Plot of Total Stats by Generation

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of the Pokémon dataset. We performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and answered various questions through data analysis and visualization. The insights gained can help in understanding the characteristics and distribution of Pokémon across different generations and types.
